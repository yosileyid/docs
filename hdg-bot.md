Just a simple repo to hold all the base files you will need to get a bot set up on your discord server. Simply install this base package and touch .env then include your info. This package depends on `dotenv` and the gitignore has .env added so no worries about someone seeing your key. We are not actively developing on this project, it took a backseat, but it is still in the repo to be worked on. Feel free to join our discord server and we will help you do whatever you need with it.
