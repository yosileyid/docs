# Configuration

Configuration of a jekyll theme is mainly handled in the `_config.yml` file. The theme author will usually leave comments in the file to help guide you along. Below are my themes and how to configure them. I am working on expanding these so give me time, I will update the docs as I am able. You can always contribute on github by helping me update docs!!
